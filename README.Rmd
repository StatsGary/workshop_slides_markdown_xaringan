Supporting code for **Xaringan slides** workshop.

Part of the DataFest Workshop Series. [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a means of applying structure to the prose in your coding document.  Using R Markdown and the xaringan package, attendees will integrate code with natural language (i.e. prose) to render presentation slides as a reproducible report.  The method of integrating code with prose is known as literate coding.  Attendees will focus their energies on rendering slides as one type of report while being introduced to an array of report types that can be generated from the same code.

### Prerequisites

Introductory familiarity with R and the Tidyverse (e.g. [quickStart with R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/r_flipped/), part 1)

- Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) on your computer
- tidyverese and xaringan packages installed in your R environment
    - `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "xaringan"))`
